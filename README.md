#Introduction to FileDo

FileDo is a mac app that allows you to run various file rename actions on your files. I noticed there arent too many free renaming apps for the mac that allow for various raname operations like find/replace insert text numeric sequencing and other fun things.

This app is still underway and is not complete.
